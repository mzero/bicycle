Bicycle
=======

[] display mode
[] display layers, un muted in inversion
[] display length in seconds
[] fix display when clear (it shouldn't have end bar)
[] display cells in use (?)

[] something is still messed up about lenghts
	- play rapid short chords - some notes are held toooooo long


Next
----

[] layer range controls

[] layer fixes
	[] when armed, layers overwrite, but when you hit keep, it moves
		to next layer, and may leave remnants if you don't play a whole
		repeat
		- either a command to clear the layer  +1
		- or clear the layer on arm
		- or accept the punch-in/punch-out behavior as correct
		- or have keep stay on same layer?
	[] a way to over-dub into a layer, not punch?

[] long notes
	- note held all through the loop
	- note held near end of loop, through to start
		- esp. when same pitch as note at start of loop
	- when starting a new note on pitch X should cancel the pending
		note off for pitch X, yes?
		- also cancel or end any awaiting offs?

[] auto record a note at start
	- serves as start of loop
	- map to one of the trigger outs

[] clean up delta times and checking for overflows
	- durations on note off
	- advance big jump
	- others?

[] use Pi to route midi:
	boppad -> pi -> buddy
	blueboard -> pi -> buddy
	buddy -> pi -> pisound din midi -> pulsar


laters
======

[] rationalize channels?
	- ch. 16 is control
	- but somethings on playing channels could be control
      like sustain pedal (CC 64) for "keep" function

[] some configuration system

[] other possible controls
	[] clear last layer/epoch

[] double / half loop

[] two loops?
[] different length layers? (would be like multiple loops, sync'd to
	ration of lengths)








Later
-----
[] async the loops if desired



Hardware
--------
[] basic schematic
[] breadboard of device
