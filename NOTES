Bicycle To Do
=============

On Deck
-------
[] awaiting off table needs to be by note & channel
  - that's too big to be reasonable - so will need to do some kind of hashed
    table scheme. In general, don't expect to be waiting more than 10 notes
    at a time.

[] configuration

[] measure processing time
[] timed polling of ALSA

[] odd immediate loop start with launchpad pro on program start
	- must be some odd ALSA message, or some unexpected MIDI


Bugs
----
[] handle failed beat estimates better
	- don't generate MIDI clock in these cases
	[] there is a divide by zero in there somewhere

Features
--------
[] feedback to controller's buttons for mute and arm

[] MIDI channel shift (?)
[] visual, live configuration
  [] save & restore from files
[] track fx
  [] erosion: remove more and more notes (stable) as fader turned down
  [] quantization (?)
  [] 2x , 1/2x speed
  [] octave shift
  [] diatonic shift (?- ick, then you need to know the key...)
[] visual representation of recorded notes (? probably not really a good idea)
[] more than 10 layers?
  [] would need heap algo. for sorting next event
[] double tap clear to get quiet all now
	- finishes all notes immediately

Implementation
--------------
[] displaying too often
	[] what is the timing of the display operation?



Other Ideas
-----------
[] Abelton Link (?)
[] layer range controls
[] layer fixes
	[] when armed, layers overwrite, but when you hit keep, it moves
		to next layer, and may leave remnants if you don't play a whole
		repeat
		- either a command to clear the layer  +1
		- or clear the layer on arm
		- or accept the punch-in/punch-out behavior as correct
		- or have keep stay on same layer?
	[] a way to over-dub into a layer, not punch?

[] long notes
	- note held all through the loop
	- note held near end of loop, through to start
		- esp. when same pitch as note at start of loop
	- when starting a new note on pitch X should cancel the pending
		note off for pitch X, yes?
		- also cancel or end any awaiting offs?

[] rationalize channels?
	- ch. 16 is control
	- but somethings on playing channels could be control
      like sustain pedal (CC 64) for "keep" function

[] async the loops if desired




HW Notes
========

USB Host
--------
Arudino Host Shield: (Retired)
	https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-usb-host-shield
	open HW: https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/USBHostShield-Rev2.pdf
	uses MAX3421E chip:
		USB host + 8 GPI + 8 GPO; via SPI
		https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/controllers-expanders/MAX3421E.html

SparkFun's USB Shield is similar:
	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9947
	same chip


Bitluni's USB host feather thing:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3FBdY0GS4&feature=youtu.be
	CH559 dual USB host controller chip

Adafruit Trinket M0
	- has host ability
	- used in this MIDI USB Host thing
		https://hackaday.io/project/161715-midi-usb-host-to-midi-din-converter
		https://github.com/gdsports/midiuartusbh

Another approach - a Pi Zero and a hub
	- just use a script to aconnect every second
