[x] absolute time in Looper

[x] switch to note lengths
	[x] queue of note offs
	[x] pending offs by note
		[x] keep absolute time of start (keep as array)
		[x] clear await on clear



[] interpret some notes as triggers

[] auto record a note at start
	- serves as start of loop
	- map to one of the trigger outs

[] display info
	- length of loop
	- cells in use / free
	- state: arm'd / rec'g / over'g
	- place in loop

[] rationalize channels?

[] clean up delta times and checking for overflows
	- durations on note off
	- advance big jump
	- others?



[] map Boppad triggers
	[] notes
	[] cc for radii
[] boppad notes trigger trigger outputs on buddy
[] use Pi to route midi:
	boppad -> pi -> buddy
	blueboard -> pi -> buddy
	buddy -> pi -> pisound din midi -> pulsar


laters
======

[] double / half loop





[] all notes off when clearing
	- otherwise things get stuck on
	? track or use the magic thing?
		0xBn 123 0 , for n in (0,15)
	? OR - track off as a duration of a hit, queue those to play separately?
		- and so they trail off and turn off as they would have


[] loop controls extracted from CC commands should
	perhaps be filtered by channel? configurable?



[] Layers, not epochs?
	[] layer is just last loop's worth, or sum since start?
		- user option?
	[] controls for limiting range of layers played, hi and lo!
	[] clear layer? trim to playing layers?
	[] are 256 layers enough? probably?




[] merge with buffer
[] "the one" output trigger

[] process output midi
	[] output to MIDI on another set of channels
	[] output to output handler (see below)

[] channel to differentiate two channels of loop
[] note velocity to CV V
[] radius CC to CV R
[] note on / off to trig 1

[] mute control (keeps things playing)






Later

[] async the loops if desired
