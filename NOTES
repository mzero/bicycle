=======

[x] USB CIN value on play
[x] handle time overflow gracefully
[x] delete unsaved epoch notes
[x] play events when recording them
[] play first event on keep()

[] fix the packet / midi types to something safe!!!

[] map Boppad triggers
	[] notes
	[] cc for radii
[] boppad notes trigger trigger outputs on buddy
[] "the one" trigger
[] use Pi to route midi:
	boppad -> pi -> buddy
	blueboard -> pi -> buddy
	buddy -> pi -> pisound din midi -> pulsar


[] all notes off when clearing
	- otherwise things get stuck on
	? track or use the magic thing?
		0xBn 123 0 , for n in (0,15)
	? OR - track off as a duration of a hit, queue those to play separately?
		- and so they trail off and turn off as they would have


[] loop controls extracted from CC commands should
	perhaps be filtered by channel? configurable?



[] Layers, not epochs?
	[] layer is just last loop's worth, or sum since start?
		- user option?
	[] controls for limiting range of layers played, hi and lo!
	[] clear layer? trim to playing layers?
	[] are 256 layers enough? probably?




[] merge with buffer
[] "the one" output trigger

[] process output midi
	[] output to MIDI on another set of channels
	[] output to output handler (see below)

[] channel to differentiate two channels of loop
[] note velocity to CV V
[] radius CC to CV R
[] note on / off to trig 1

[] mute control (keeps things playing)






Later
-----
[] async the loops if desired



Hardware
--------
[] basic schematic
[] breadboard of device
