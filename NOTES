[x] absolute time in Looper

[x] switch to note lengths
	[x] queue of note offs
	[x] pending offs by note
		[x] keep absolute time of start (keep as array)
		[x] clear await on clear



[] interpret some notes as triggers
	Sequence: pin D23 (MOSI), ch 2 note 50
	Measure: pin D1 (TX)
	Beat: pin D24 (SCK), ch 1 note 38
	Tuplet: pin D22 (MISO), ch 1 note 36


[] auto record a note at start
	- serves as start of loop
	- map to one of the trigger outs

[] display info
	- length of loop
	- cells in use / free
	- state: arm'd / rec'g / over'g
	- place in loop

[] rationalize channels?

[] clean up delta times and checking for overflows
	- durations on note off
	- advance big jump
	- others?



[x] map Boppad triggers
	Bottom two pads
		ch 1, note 36 & note 38
		c1 1, cc 70, 71 are initial radius
	Top two pads
		ch 2, note 48 & note 42

	use ch 2, note 50 as "loop start"

[] use Pi to route midi:
	boppad -> pi -> buddy
	blueboard -> pi -> buddy
	buddy -> pi -> pisound din midi -> pulsar

[] loop controls extracted from CC commands should
	perhaps be filtered by channel? configurable?

[] Layers, not epochs?
	[] layer is just last loop's worth, or sum since start?
		- user option?
	[] controls for limiting range of layers played, hi and lo!
		- can do proportional fades!
	[] clear layer? trim to playing layers?
	[] are 256 layers enough? probably?
	[] layer volumes?


[] other possible controls
	[] clear last layer/epoch
	[] clear current epoch/layer (so you can start without waiting for the repeat)
	[] mute control (keeps things playing)

[] double / half loop

[] two loops?
