=======



[] fix display when clear (it shouldn't have end bar)
[] display cells in use (?)
[] displaying too often
	[] what is the timing of the display operation?

[] something is still messed up about lenghts
	- play rapid short chords - some notes are held toooooo long

[] 2nd arm is total clear ??
[] fix hack of start note definition
	[] ? should be START command? what about duration of trigger?


[] AbsTime & DeltaTime are terrible names
[] catch exit in RPi version and end all notes



Next
----

[] layer range controls

[] layer fixes
	[] when armed, layers overwrite, but when you hit keep, it moves
		to next layer, and may leave remnants if you don't play a whole
		repeat
		- either a command to clear the layer  +1
		- or clear the layer on arm
		- or accept the punch-in/punch-out behavior as correct
		- or have keep stay on same layer?
	[] a way to over-dub into a layer, not punch?

[] long notes
	- note held all through the loop
	- note held near end of loop, through to start
		- esp. when same pitch as note at start of loop
	- when starting a new note on pitch X should cancel the pending
		note off for pitch X, yes?
		- also cancel or end any awaiting offs?

[] clean up delta times and checking for overflows
	- durations on note off
	- advance big jump
	- others?



laters
======

[] rationalize channels?
	- ch. 16 is control
	- but somethings on playing channels could be control
      like sustain pedal (CC 64) for "keep" function

[] some configuration system

[] other possible controls
	[] clear last layer/epoch

[] double / half loop

[] two loops?
[] different length layers? (would be like multiple loops, sync'd to
	ration of lengths)

[] async the loops if desired

[] tracking playing speed
[] output MIDI clock and/or clock pulse on an output

USB Host
--------
Arudino Host Shield: (Retired)
	https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-usb-host-shield
	open HW: https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/USBHostShield-Rev2.pdf
	uses MAX3421E chip:
		USB host + 8 GPI + 8 GPO; via SPI
		https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/controllers-expanders/MAX3421E.html

SparkFun's USB Shield is similar:
	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9947
	same chip


Bitluni's USB host feather thing:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3FBdY0GS4&feature=youtu.be
	CH559 dual USB host controller chip

Adafruit Trinket M0
	- has host ability
	- used in this MIDI USB Host thing
		https://hackaday.io/project/161715-midi-usb-host-to-midi-din-converter
		https://github.com/gdsports/midiuartusbh

Another approach - a Pi Zero and a hub
	- just use a script to aconnect every second
